🎵 Nginx-Music — Public Jellyfin Streaming via VPS Reverse Proxy
Overview

Nginx-Music is Tresor's public media streaming layer — an nginx reverse proxy on the VPS that forwards HTTPS traffic through the WireGuard tunnel to a dedicated Jellyfin instance (jellyfin-music) on the home node.

This exists because Cloudflare Tunnel's TOS prohibits video/audio streaming traffic. Rather than risking a CF account ban, all media streaming bypasses Cloudflare entirely and goes through the VPS directly with Let's Encrypt TLS.

Component	Host	Role	Network
Nginx	tresor-vps	TLS termination + reverse proxy	public (ports 80, 443)
WireGuard	tresor-vps ↔ tresor	Encrypted tunnel	10.66.66.0/24
Jellyfin-Music	tresor	Dedicated streaming instance	bridge + internal_net, bound to 10.66.66.2:18096
Browser / App
    ↓ HTTPS (443)
music.raduhhr.xyz (VPS public IP)
    ↓ nginx reverse proxy
    ↓ TLS terminated (Let's Encrypt)
WireGuard tunnel (10.66.66.1 → 10.66.66.2)
    ↓ HTTP (18096)
jellyfin-music container (Tresor)

Key distinction: This is a completely separate Jellyfin instance from the LAN-only jellyfin container. The LAN instance serves the full media library on 192.168.0.42:8096. The public instance (jellyfin-music) is locked to 10.66.66.2:18096 and only accessible through the VPS.

Why Not Cloudflare Tunnel?

Cloudflare's Self-Serve Subscription Agreement §2.8 prohibits using their network to serve disproportionate amounts of non-HTML content — specifically video and audio streaming. While enforcement varies, violating TOS risks account termination, which would take down all other services routed through the tunnel (Uptime Kuma, landing site, etc.).

The VPS reverse proxy solution:

No CF dependency for streaming traffic
Direct TLS via Let's Encrypt (no CF edge involved)
Same WireGuard tunnel already in use for Minecraft
Minimal cost — VPS already paid for

Role Behavior (roles/nginx-music)
Deployment flow:
Installs nginx, certbot, python3-certbot-nginx
Opens UFW ports 80/443
Renders HTTP-only bootstrap config (for ACME challenge)
Issues Let's Encrypt cert via certbot --nginx
Renders full TLS config with security hardening
Reloads nginx
Pre-flight:
Probes 10.66.66.2:18096 over WireGuard before deploying
Warns (but continues) if backend unreachable — allows cert issuance even if Tresor is temporarily down
Config templates:
music.http.nginx.j2 — minimal HTTP config for initial cert issuance
music.tls.nginx.j2 — full production config with TLS, rate limiting, security headers, and API blocking
Security Model
Network layer
Nginx listens on VPS public IP (ports 80/443 only)
All traffic to Jellyfin goes through encrypted WireGuard tunnel
jellyfin-music is bound exclusively to 10.66.66.2:18096 — unreachable from LAN or public internet
UFW on VPS allows only: 22/tcp, 51820/udp, 25565/tcp, 80/tcp, 443/tcp
Application layer (nginx hardening)

Rate limiting:

General requests: 10 req/s with burst of 20
Strict endpoints (login, websockets): 5 req/s with burst of 5

Connection limits:

Max 20 concurrent connections per IP

Security headers:

X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
Permissions-Policy — disables geolocation, microphone, camera, payment, USB
Content Security Policy tuned for Jellyfin UI

Blocked API endpoints:

The following paths are blocked at the nginx level to prevent information leakage:

/System/*, /Users/*, /Branding/*, /health, /Sessions/*, /Devices/* — system info and user enumeration
/swagger, /api-docs, /manage, /admin — admin/debug interfaces
/Items/*/File, /Audio/*/universal, /Videos/*/stream — direct file download bypass

Allowed HTTP methods: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS only

Logging:

Blocked requests → /var/log/nginx/jellyfin_blocked.log
Denied requests → /var/log/nginx/jellyfin_denied.log
Container Profile (jellyfin-music)
Setting	Value
Container name	jellyfin-music
Image	jellyfin/jellyfin:latest
Bind address	10.66.66.2:18096 (WG interface only)
Networks	bridge, internal_net
Media	Same library as LAN Jellyfin (mounted RO)
Config	Separate config dir from LAN instance

This is a dedicated instance with its own config, users, and playback state. It shares the media library via read-only mounts but is otherwise fully isolated from the LAN Jellyfin.

Packet Flow (detailed)
Client (phone/browser)
    ↓ DNS: music.raduhhr.xyz → 49.12.100.57 (Hetzner VPS)
    ↓ TCP 443 (HTTPS)
VPS nginx (TLS termination)
    ↓ rate limit + security headers + API blocking
    ↓ proxy_pass http://10.66.66.2:18096
WireGuard tunnel (UDP 51820)
    ↓ 10.66.66.1 → 10.66.66.2
Tresor — jellyfin-music container
    ↓ bound to 10.66.66.2:18096 only
    ↓ serves media from /mnt/hdd/data/media (RO)
Relationship to Other Services
Service	Path	Notes
jellyfin (LAN)	192.168.0.42:8096	Full media server, LAN-only, VAAPI HW accel
jellyfin-music (public)	10.66.66.2:18096 via VPS	Public streaming, WG-only, nginx TLS frontend
Cloudflare Tunnel	*.raduhhr.xyz (non-streaming)	Web apps only — no media traffic
Velocity (MC)	49.12.100.57:25565	Shares VPS but completely separate

No streaming traffic touches Cloudflare. Web services go through CF Tunnel → Traefik. Media streaming goes through VPS nginx → WireGuard → jellyfin-music. These paths are fully independent.

Troubleshooting
Symptom	Likely Cause	Fix
502 Bad Gateway	WireGuard tunnel down or jellyfin-music stopped	sudo wg show on both nodes; docker ps on tresor
Cert renewal fails	Port 80 blocked or nginx misconfigured	sudo certbot renew --dry-run; check UFW
Slow playback / buffering	WG latency or bandwidth cap	Check wg show transfer stats; test with iperf3
403 on API endpoints	nginx blocks sensitive paths by design	Expected behavior — check jellyfin_blocked.log
Rate limited (429)	Too many requests from single IP	Adjust nginx_music_rate_limit_* vars
"Connection refused" in nginx logs	jellyfin-music not bound to WG IP	Verify docker inspect jellyfin-music shows 10.66.66.2:18096
HSTS causing issues on HTTP	Browser cached strict-transport-security	Clear HSTS in browser; ensure cert is valid

Gotchas
Certbot modifies nginx config — the --nginx plugin rewrites the server block during issuance. The Ansible role handles this by rendering the TLS template after cert issuance, overwriting certbot's changes with the hardened config.
Cert auto-renewal — certbot installs a systemd timer (certbot.timer) that handles renewal automatically. The nginx plugin reloads nginx after renewal.
Two Jellyfin instances, separate configs — don't confuse jellyfin (LAN, port 8096) with jellyfin-music (WG, port 18096). They have independent databases, users, and playback states.
DNS must point directly to VPS — music.raduhhr.xyz needs an A record to 49.12.100.57, NOT proxied through Cloudflare (orange cloud off). CF proxying would re-introduce the TOS issue.
VPS bandwidth — Hetzner CX23 includes 20TB/month. Monitor usage if streaming heavily.
